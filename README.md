# Windows 8 Time Picker for Windows Phone
This project was migrated from its original home one CodePlex at https://win8timepicker.codeplex.com/
#About

This simple library gives Windows Phone developers access to a time picker based upon Microsoft's new control in the Windows 8.1 Alarms app. Users select the time by sliding the rings, the outermost controlling the minutes and the inner controlling the hours.
